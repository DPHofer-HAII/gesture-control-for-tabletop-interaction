## Gesture Control for Tabletop Interaction
Welcome to the Gesture Control for Tabletop Interaction repository! This repository contains video material and applications/scripts related to gesture control for tabletop interactions. 

# Gesture Videos
Explore video material showcasing 11 different gestures recorded during the HyLTE project's user study. These videos serve as valuable resources for understanding and analyzing user interactions.

# Unity Applications
Four Unity applications are included. The four applications are split into two Gesture Dictionaries. Each Gesture Dictionary has a training application and a study application. Training is for getting participants confortable with the gestures, whereas the study... well... it is the study!

# Python Scripts
Two Python scripts are available, designed to work with the Unity applications. Replicate the experiment and gather more gesture data using this combination.

# Replicating the Experiment
To recreate the gesture collection experiment:

Unity Setup: Choose the appropriate Unity programm. 
Python Integration: Run the corresponding Python script alongside the Unity application for interaction and data collection.
Setup Requirements: Ensure a similar setup with a camera and projector recording/projecting from the ceiling onto a table.
