## Gesture Control for Tabletop Interaction
Welcome to the Gesture Control for Tabletop Interaction repository! This repository contains applications/scripts related to gesture control for tabletop interactions. I also provide a video database with videos that can be used for model training. But it is too big for the free GitHub version so you need to shoot me a message and I send them to you (might take a day or two though).

# Python Scripts
Two Python scripts are available, designed to work with the Unity applications. Replicate the experiment and gather more gesture data using this combination. The libraries that are used in the scripts need to be installed. This might take a while.

# Unity Applications
Four Unity applications are included. The four applications are split into two Gesture Dictionaries. Each Gesture Dictionary has a training application and a study application. Training is for getting participants confortable with the gestures, whereas the study... well... it is the study! Here as well the unity packages need to be installed. Especially ZeroMQ takes a while. A good tutorial for that would be: https://vinnik-dmitry07.medium.com/a-python-unity-interface-with-zeromq-12720d6b7288

# Gesture Videos
Explore video material showcasing 11 different gestures recorded during the HyLTE project's user study. These videos serve as valuable resources for understanding and analyzing user interactions. As mentioned in the introduction: write me to get access.

# Replicating the Experiment
To recreate the gesture collection experiment:

Unity Setup: Choose the appropriate Unity programm. 
Python Integration: Run the corresponding Python script alongside the Unity application for interaction and data collection.
Setup Requirements: Ensure a similar setup with a camera and projector recording/projecting from the ceiling onto a table.

Feel free to use the materials provided here. DISCLAIMER: There will be no support provided other than the video database.
